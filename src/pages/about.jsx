      <div className="about-text-container">
        <p>I work as a freelance filmmaker, director and cinematographer based in Torbay, Devon, UK with a Bachelor of Arts – 1st Degree Honours in Media Arts from the University of Plymouth.</p>

        <p>Often I see images and have ideas that I would like to share with others. This is how my films come about.  I enjoy experimenting so my work covers a wide range of subjects, styles and techniques: documentaries, shorts, promotional, music videos, experimental and more!</p>

        <p>Primarily as a cinematographer, I operate on a RED digital cinema camera, but have experience with other camera systems from a wide array of brands Sony, Panasonic, Canon and Arri. I also have additional support kit, such as 360 motion control rigs for dynamic time-lapses and experience with steadycam or MoVI, DJI Ronin gimbal rigs.</p>

        <p>I have an excellent understanding of editing and basic colour correction ranging across short-form tv and web commercials to documentary or music videos. Whilst using the Final Cut Pro or Adobe CC suite, my system is both on and offsite and able to edit and view 4k content natively.  Essential for high-end delivery.</p>
